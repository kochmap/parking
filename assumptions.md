1. Fee is calculated by adding hour rates e.g. 4 hours of parking for regular rate will cost (1 + 2 + 4 + 8) = 15
2. Application use in memory sql database h2.
3. Application run on 9000 port.
4. Starting of non-existing parking meter will create new one.
5. Testing requests examples in intellij idea format are in requests directory.
6. "Check if vehicle has started the parking meter" I assumed that system check if there is an active parking ticket 
    for that vehicle. Active parking ticket means that for specific car parking meter has been started and 
    hasn't been stopped yet.
